## Overview

GlucoGuard is a machine learning model focused on predicting the likelihood of a diabetic patient's readmission to a hospital within 30 days after being discharged. The model utilizes the Responsible AI Dashboard in Azure Machine Learning Studio to ensure its performance aligns with ethical considerations, such as fairness, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability, and reliability.

**Model**: [Responsible AI Dashboard](https://github.com/ruyakubu/BUILD-AzureML-workshop/tree/main)
